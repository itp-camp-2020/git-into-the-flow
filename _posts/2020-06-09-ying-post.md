Some quick markdown (this file type) tips:

# headings begin with a hash symbol
## this is a smaller heading
## and an even smaller heading

- Lists are written
- like
- this

hello hello hello!! [https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pexels.com%2Fsearch%2Fcat%2F&psig=AOvVaw3slfhdZtVrTHOy7fiTDBMm&ust=1591830054520000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLDzvJnr9ekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD]

To add a link, put the [link text in square brackets](https://AndTheUrlInParenthesesNextToIt.com).

Adding an image is similar to a link, but needs an exclamation mark in front of it, examples below:

![image description text for a remote image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Example.jpg)

![image description text for an image from a local folder in this project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nyc.jpg)

Videos can be embedded using an iframe code snippet (commonly found when using the share as embedded video feature on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38v51JvIv0A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
